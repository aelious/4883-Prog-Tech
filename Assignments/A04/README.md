#### Decisions:
UVA & LeetCode seem like decent learning tools. UVA's website is pretty dated and their servers aren't always down, but their problems seem solid as well as the uDebug testing suite. I'm fine to use either. 

Edit: I meant to say that UVA's servers aren't always up, but I think this is more appropriate given our collective experience with the site being down :-)
